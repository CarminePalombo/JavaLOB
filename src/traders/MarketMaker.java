/**
 * These agents simultaneously post an order on each side of the book, 
 * maintaining an approximately neutral position throughout the day. They make 
 * their income from the difference between their bids and offers. If one or 
 * both limit orders is executed, it will be replaced by a new one the next time 
 * the market maker is chosen to trade. Each round, the market maker updates 
 * a prediction for the sign of the next periodâ€™s order using a simple $w$
 * period rolling-mean estimate. When a market maker predicts that a buy order 
 * will arrive next, she will set her sell limit order volume to a uniformly 
 * distributed random number between $v_{min}$ and $v_{max}$ and her buy limit 
 * order volume to 1.
